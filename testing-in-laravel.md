# [Testing: Getting Started](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/testing)

## Introduction

By default, your application's tests directory contains two directories:

1. Feature Testing
2. Unit Testing

### Unit Testing:

Unit tests are tests that focus on a very small, isolated portion of your code. In fact, most unit tests probably focus
on a single method. Tests within your "Unit" test directory do not boot your Laravel application and therefore are
unable to access your application's database or other framework services.

### Feature Testing:

Feature tests may test a larger portion of your code, including how several objects interact with each other or even a
full HTTP request to a `JSON` endpoint. Generally, most of your tests should be feature tests. These types of tests
provide the most confidence that your system as a whole is functioning as intended.


An `ExampleTest.php` file is provided in both the Feature and Unit test directories. After installing a new Laravel application, execute the `vendor/bin/pest`, `vendor/bin/phpunit`, or `php artisan test` commands to run your tests.

## Environment

When running tests, Laravel will automatically set the configuration environment to testing because of the environment variables defined in the `phpunit.xml` file. Laravel also automatically configures the session and cache to the `array` driver so that no session or cache data will be persisted while testing.


## Laravel Testing Interview Questions

### Q1: What is PHPUnit and how is it used in Laravel?
**Answer**: PHPUnit is the primary testing framework for PHP, integrated into Laravel by default. Laravel's `phpunit.xml` is pre-configured to facilitate testing, allowing developers to create and run tests using the `php artisan test` command or directly via PHPUnit.

### Q2: What are feature tests in Laravel? How do they differ from unit tests?
**Answer**: Feature tests in Laravel cover a larger portion of the application, such as interactions between several objects or an entire HTTP request cycle. Unit tests focus on isolated units of the code, typically individual methods. Feature tests ensure broader functionality, while unit tests ensure that specific, small components operate correctly.

### Q3: Can you describe how to use Laravel's built-in testing functions to simulate user interactions?
**Answer**: Laravel provides methods like `$this->actingAs($user)` for simulating a logged-in user and `$this->post('/route', $data)` for simulating form submissions. These functions are essential for testing user interactions with the application, ensuring that authentication and data processing behave as expected.

### Q4: How do you test middleware in Laravel?
**Answer**: Middleware can be tested by making HTTP requests to routes that apply the middleware and asserting the expected responses. Middleware tests ensure that requests are handled properly, including authentication checks and data validation.

### Q5: What is Mockery and how is it used in Laravel tests?
**Answer**: Mockery is a mock object framework for PHP used in Laravel to create and manage mock objects. It is particularly useful for testing classes in isolation by mocking their dependencies, thus focusing tests on the functionality of the class itself without external influences.

### Q6: Explain database testing in Laravel and the role of migrations.
**Answer**: Laravel's database testing often uses transactions to rollback changes after each test, maintaining a clean database state. Migrations ensure the database schema is appropriate for the tests. The `RefreshDatabase` trait can be used to automatically reset the database state before each test.

### Q7: How do you handle configuration and environment variables in testing?
**Answer**: Laravel allows for specific configurations for testing through the `.env.testing` file. Test-specific environment settings can be defined here, overriding the main environment settings. Additionally, the `config()` helper can be used within tests to set or get configuration values dynamically.

### Q8: What are some common assertions used in Laravel tests?
**Answer**: Common assertions include `$this->assertEquals()`, `$this->assertTrue()`, `$this->assertDatabaseHas()`, and `$this->assertJson()`. These assertions help verify that the application behaves as expected, checking values, database states, and JSON structures.

### Q9: What is the purpose of factories in Laravel testing?
**Answer**: Factories are used to generate test data for models. They help create a realistic environment for tests, providing a way to easily generate and manipulate model instances with dummy data suitable for the scope of the tests being performed.

### Q10: How would you use Laravel Dusk for browser testing?
**Answer**: Laravel Dusk provides an expressive API for browser automation and testing. It is used to test JavaScript behavior and user interactions with the application from a browser perspective, simulating real user actions like clicking and typing.
